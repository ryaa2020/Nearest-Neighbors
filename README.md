# Nearest-Neighbors

# Description

Three different projects working with the K-nearest neighbors algorithm!

* Births
  * I first cleaned the data because there are lots of incorrect dates! Then, I built a knn model to predict whether the dates are above-median (1) or below-median (0) births for each date. 

* Digits
  * I built a knn model to predict the digit written (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9) from all 1700+ handwritten digits, based on the 64 pixel values (pix0 through pix63). Then, I created a function that allows you to indicate how many pixels to use in predicting the correct digit-labels... anywhere from 8 (crazy) to 64 (the full dataset). 

* Titanic
  * I built a knn model to predict whether a Titanic passenger, based on their data, would have survived (1) or perished (0). I did further research by conducting feature weighting to see which feature was the most influential in predicting the outcome of a Titannic passenger.
